### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**Ternse/Ternse** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my Associate Degree in Computer Science. I've been working on it since 2021.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning C++, though I do know a bit of python and JavaScript.
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m not currently looking to collaborate, though will be willing too.
- ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m not currently looking for help with anything. Well maybe a bit of how to use github but I think I'm getting the hang of it.
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about hopefully nothing ask I not sure how to answer.
- ğŸ“« How to reach me: Currently the only way to reach me is through here.

I see, the stuff above was ideas on what to write here. I'll fix it later, unless I forget to. Hello there, you may be wonder how you got here. Unless it was intentional.
I've been learning Coding since 2021, though techinally I did do a coding class in 2019 for college credit. I'm still new to coding and some of the languages I've learned
over the years is C++, Javascript, Java, and Python. I did try to dabble with C# but I didn't know what I was doing. I'm not currently looking to collaborate with anyone,
though I am open to the idea of it. There is currently no way to reach me besides here, until I set an email up of course. I think that is it, unless I think of something
else to change here.
