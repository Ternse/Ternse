### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**Ternse/Ternse** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.


I see, the stuff above was ideas on what to write here. I'll fix it later, unless I forget to. Hello there, you may be wonder how you got here. Unless it was intentional.
I've been learning Coding since 2021, though techinally I did do a coding class in 2019 for college credit. I'm still new to coding and some of the languages I've learned
over the years is C++, Javascript, Java, and Python. I did try to dabble with C# but I didn't know what I was doing. I'm not currently looking to collaborate with anyone,
though I am open to the idea of it. There is currently no way to reach me besides here, until I set an email up of course. I think that is it, unless I think of something
else to change here. Oh I just remembered, I'm currently working part time at a movie theater while part time at college. That's fun, not really. It's hard to be sarcastic
through text. I guess I should delete the stuff above since I'm here. AND I ALSO FORGOT TO SAY MY NAME!! Hi, I'm Ternse. What does it mean? I do not know, hopefully nothing
bad cause that would be awkward as I just made it up. As you can see, I tend to be a bit scattered brained, but that happens when you have everything though running through
your brain 90 miles per hour or about 144km/h. I'm on at odd hours, I do not know why. That's just how I role. I think that's everything. Will update if I remember something.
